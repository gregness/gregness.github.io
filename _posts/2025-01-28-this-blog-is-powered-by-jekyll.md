These days there is a myriad of selection between static site generators: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) to name the most popular ones.

But they can be considered younglings when compared to the grandfather of static site generators, which is [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), released in the year 2008.

It was the first widely adopted modern static site generator, launched by GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner.

GitHub's adoption of Jekyll for GitHub Pages in 2009 gave it massive exposure and influenced the design and architecture of many other static site generators that followed.

I'm a big fan of software that ["just works"](https://jekyllrb.com/philosophy/). Nearing 10 years of tinkering with the web platform, I've come to appreciate tools and frameworks that have stood the test of time.

Jekyll is elegantly simple, and thatâ€™s the reason I chose it. And I want to get closer to the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language as well. It's no coincidence that Jekyll and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) are written in Ruby.
