If you have meddled with SEO you probably know what [schema](https://schema.org), [linked data](https://json-ld.org) and [rich results](hhttps://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery) mean.

It's no joke getting all of them correct. And I didn't even mention [open graph](https://ogp.me), which is probably the most used. You just have to have to enter some meta tags.

Luckily there are some tools to check your markup. The most important one is [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results). You can enter a URL and Google will validate whether your markup translates into rich results or not.

To test open graph markup for blog posts, there is [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector). You have to be logged in to LinkedIn for that on.

Lastly there is [Open Graph Validator](https://orcascan.com/tools/open-graph-validator) from OrcaScan. You can use it without being logged in to anywhere.
