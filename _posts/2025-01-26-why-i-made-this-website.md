I have always thought of posting, but never did. Iâ€™m not sure what to post. What I am kind of sure about is that I want to start each post with an image I like.

So here is a hummingbird and four bees sharing a drinking fountain. There is something fascinating about that photo. Will I order a print? Who knows.

Getting this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog live will be a great testament to me actually following through with this blog. A betting man would not have put money on that.

After meddling with [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/) for a while, I got kind of worn out. I was doing all these changes and it never stopped because it's kind of an old theme, so there is much to do.

Instead, I opted to create a blank blog. Why not? I can add just what I want and not a bit more. I'll share more about this process soon.
