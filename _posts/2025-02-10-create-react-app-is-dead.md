[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is dead. Create React App remains dead. And we have to migrate to modern build tooling.

This is coming from a front-end developer who has used Create React App and migrated away to [Vite](https://vite.dev).

If you want a framework, choose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/) or [Astro](https://astro.build).
