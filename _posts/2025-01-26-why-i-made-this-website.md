The thought of blogging has crossed my mind many a time.

I've never even taken the first step, which is usually all that's required.

But getting this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog live is a great testament to my ability to follow through.

After meddling with [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/) – a Jekyll theme I like – for a while, I got kind of worn out and lost momentum.

I was doing all of these stylistic changes, and I never got anywhere with it.

Instead, I started from zero. I created a blank [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog.

And voilà! What you see before your eyes is the fruit of that endeavor.

I want to improve my writing. I want to hone my articulation by putting thoughts and insights in writing. In this blog.
