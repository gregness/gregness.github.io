The [M4 Mac mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) fits in the palm of your hand.

And what a powerhouse at that size. Not to mention the price tag, which is quite affordable.

It is the perfect budget PC for a Mac user like myself – who has been using Apple products for almost 10 years now.

The M4 Mac mini is powered by 4.4GHz 10-processor cores, 10 GPU cores, and 16 [Neural Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_Engine) cores. Firing on all cylinders.

I’ve been using it for several days now, and the experience is very smooth. Everything is instant and snappy. Not even a hiccup.

Prior to the purchase of the M4 Mac mini, on the journey of upgrading the tech I use, I got my self the [MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical-mini.html) keyboard and the [MX Master 3S](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.910-006558.html) mouse.

The only thing missing from my ideal setup is a [Dell UltraSharp 43" monitor](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-43-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u4323qe/apd/210-bfpo/monitors-monitor-accessories). Now that's some serious screen real estate.
