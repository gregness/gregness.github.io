  <p>I'm a curious and pragmatic fella. Most times you can find me tinkering with the web. While I consider myself a web developer, I am currently employed as a front-end developer.</p>
  <p>I find the title front-end developer limiting, because I work on the web platform, which encompasses not only client-side but server infrastructure too.</p>
  <p>I've also worked as a back-end developer and a security engineer at a bank. There I gained a lot of experience on the infrastructure side of things.</p>
