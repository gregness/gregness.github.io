title: Why I started this blog

I've wanted to start blogging for some time now. But I've never taken the first step – which is usually all you need. This time is different because I actually got this Jekyll blog up and running. How did this happen?

I meddled with Hyde – a Jekyll theme I like – for a while, and I got worn out and lost momentum. I was doing all these style changes, and I never got anywhere with it. You can tweak design to no end.

Instead, I started from zero. I created a blank Jekyll blog. And voilà! What you see before your eyes is the fruit of that endeavor. Starting from scratch was the right path for me. Less is more.

But the main reason for this website, blog — what have you — is that I want to improve my writing. I want to be able to articulate my ideas coherently. Share my experiences, and any insights I might have gained in concise written form.
