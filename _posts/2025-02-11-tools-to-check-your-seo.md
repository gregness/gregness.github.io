[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is dead. Create React App remains dead. And we have to migrate to modern build tooling.

Having developed a React web application a few years ago, I went the Create React App route because it was easy and simple.

Sure enough, time passed and I had to migrate to [Vite](https://vite.dev). Luckily, it wasn't a painful process.

This is a natural course for developers, updating our tools and eliminating technical debt, which only grows larger if left unattended.

Anyway, if you want a framework along with Vite, you have the choice of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Remix](https://remix.run/) or [Astro](https://astro.build). There's more actually, but finding them is left as an exercise to the reader.
