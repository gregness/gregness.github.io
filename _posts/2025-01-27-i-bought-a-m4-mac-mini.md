The M4 Mac mini fits in the palm of your hand. And what a powerhouse at that size. Not to mention the price tag, which is quite affordable. It is the perfect budget PC for a Mac user like myself. I've been using Apple products for almost 10 years now.

The M4 Mac mini is powered by 4.4GHz 10-processor cores, 10 GPU cores, and 16 Neural Engine cores. Firing on all cylinders.

Iâ€™ve been using it for several days now, and the experience is very smooth. Everything is instant and snappy. Not even a hiccup.

Prior to the purchase of the M4 Mac mini I got my self the MX Mechanical Mini keyboard and the MX Master 3S mouse. The only thing missing from my ideal setup is a Dell UltraSharp 43" monitor. Now that's some serious screen real estate.
