In my previous post, I mentioned how Jekyll gained traction thanks to its utilization for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This time I will briefly go over the infrastructure part of this website's stack.

I've gratefully accepted free hosting from GitHub for my blog as long as it's contents are public.

Not a big price to pay for managed hosting and deployment. And I got to use my own custom domain.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/free/) comes in at the network layer. Actually, its capabilities span across multiple OSI model layers.

At the free tier, I get global CDN with caching, DNS management, and basic analytics/metrics.

Iâ€™m not complaining at all. This website was already performing at optimal levels.

Being static files and just hanging about.
