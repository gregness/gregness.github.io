[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a great way to get started with a blog because it's free, and all changes are visible in version control.

I use it because it's powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Which is a great static site generator. It's elegantly simple. It's also been around for a while.
