The thought of blogging has crossed my mind many times.

Never have I even taken the first step, which usually is all that's necessary.

But getting this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) blog live will be a great testament to me actually following through with blogging.

After meddling with [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/) – a Jekyll theme I like – for a while, I got kind of worn out and lost momentum.

I was doing all of these stylistic changes, and I never got anywhere with it.

Instead, I started from zero. I created a blank blog. Why not?

And voilà! What you see before your eyes is the fruit of that endeavor.

Oh, and the main reason I created this blog? I was bored.

Plus, I want to improve my writing. I want to hone my articulation by putting thoughts & insights in writing.
