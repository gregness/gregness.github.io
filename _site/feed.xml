<p>I have always thought of posting, but never did. I’m not sure what to post. What I am kind of sure about is that I want to start each post with an image I like.</p>

<p>So here is a hummingbird and four bees sharing a drinking fountain. There is something fascinating about that photo. Will I order a print? Who knows.</p>

<p>Getting this <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> blog live will be a great testament to me actually following through with this blog <i>thingamajig</i>.</p>

<p>After meddling with <a href="https://hyde.getpoole.com/">Hyde</a> for a while, I got kind of worn out. I was doing all these tweaks and changes and it never stopped because it’s kind of an old theme, so there is much to do in that regard.</p>

<p>Instead, I opted to create a blank blog. Why not? I can add just what I want and not a bit more.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
