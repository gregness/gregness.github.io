title: Why I started this blog

I've wanted to start blogging for some time now. But I've never taken the first step – which is usually enough to get you started. This time is different because I actually got this blog up and running. How did this happen?

I meddled with Hyde – a Jekyll (static site generator in Ruby) theme I like – for a while, and I got worn out and lost momentum. I was doing all these style changes, and I never got anywhere with them. You can tweak design to no end if you don't set any clear goals.

Instead, I started from zero. I created a blank Jekyll blog. Starting from scratch was the right path for me.

But the main reason for this blog is that I want to improve my writing. And I want to do so by learning or sharing some technical tidbits I've come across while tinkering with the web.
