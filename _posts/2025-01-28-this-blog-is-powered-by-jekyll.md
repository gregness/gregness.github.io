These days there is a myriad of selection between static site generators. Hugo, Gatsby, Astro and Eleventy to name the most popular ones. But they can be considered younglings when compared to the grandfather of static site generators.

Which is Jekyll, released in the year 2008. It was the first widely adopted modern static site generator, launched by GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner. GitHub's adoption of Jekyll for GitHub Pages in 2009 gave it massive exposure. It influenced the design and architecture of many other static site generators that followed.

I've come to appreciate tools and frameworks that have stood the test of time. Big fan of software that "just works". Jekyll is elegantly simple, just works, and thatâ€™s the reason I chose it.

And I want to get closer to the Ruby programming language as well. It's no coincidence that Jekyll and Rails are written in Ruby.
