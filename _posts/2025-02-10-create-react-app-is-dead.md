[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is dead. Create React App remains dead. And we have to migrate. To modern tooling. Which is [Vite](https://vite.dev/).

This is coming from a front-end developer who has used Create React App and migrated away. So choose Vite today. Or if you want a framework, choose [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Remix](https://remix.run/).
